            Project on Console
        </h1>
        <p>
            First right click on website
            Second click on console tab on the top 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Console is also a REPL.
             You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting.
             For example, Figure 2 shows the Console next to the DevTools homepage, and Figure 3 shows that same page
             after using the Console to change the page's title.

            var first_name= "Agastya ";
            console.log(first_name);
            var last_name= "Mishra";
            console.log(last_name);
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name)
            console.log("calculations by developer");
            var sq_root_math= Math.sqrt(16);
            console.log("sqare root of 16 is ".concat (sq_root_math));
            var power_math= Math.pow(5 , 2);
            console.log("power of 5 into 2 is ".concat(power_math));
